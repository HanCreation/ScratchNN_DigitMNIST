# ScratchNN_DigitMNIST
NN for [Digit Recognizer (MNIST)](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html). Created using only Numpy and Math
---
 Built a simple neural network from scratch using only NumPy, without relying on any high-level libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. The task was to classify digits from the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits.

 ## What I learned
 - Get to know MNIST: Basic dataset for learning computer vision, and one of the MNIST is the digit recognizer
 - Numpy syntax and how to use it 
 - Visualizing math formula for forward/backward pass including each matrix/vector size
 - Converting math formula/equation into syntax
 - Creating basic network architecture without high-level libraries
 - Making function of weight initialization, forward pass, gradient descent, backward pass, update parameter, etc in python
 - Softmax and ReLU function and its derivative

 ## Update
 I just found out that torch and numpy have similar syntax, so I try to create another version with torch and with some support to GPU compute
